# Odin Recipes

This project is part of The Odin Project's Foundations course. The goal of this project is to practice and demonstrate the HTML skills learned so far by building a simple recipe website. The website will feature a home page with links to individual recipe pages, each containing details about the recipe, including a description, ingredients, and cooking steps.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Basic HTML structure and syntax
- Creating and linking multiple HTML pages
- Organizing content with headings, paragraphs, lists, and images
- Using links for navigation within a website
- Structuring a project directory and file organization

## Project Structure
The project consists of:
1. An `index.html` file that serves as the homepage.
2. A `recipes` folder containing individual recipe pages for different dishes.
3. Each recipe page has:
   - An image of the dish
   - A description of the dish
   - A list of ingredients
   - An ordered list of cooking steps

## Reflection
This project allowed me to practice organizing a simple website with multiple pages and internal links. I learned how to structure content effectively using HTML and how to use basic HTML tags like `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`, and `<img>`. I also got to experience managing files and directories in a project.
