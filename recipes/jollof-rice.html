    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Jollof Rice is a classic West African dish, particularly popular in Nigeria. It is a one-pot dish made with rice, tomatoes, onions, and a mix of spices that give it a rich and vibrant flavor. Jollof rice is often served at parties, celebrations, and everyday meals. The combination of the stewed tomato base and seasonings gives it a savory, slightly spicy taste that pairs well with grilled meats or fried plantains.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups long-grain parboiled rice</li>
        <li>1/4 cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 red bell pepper, chopped</li>
        <li>1 green bell pepper, chopped</li>
        <li>4 medium tomatoes, blended</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons curry powder</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons thyme</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon white pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ginger, grated</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic, minced</li>
        <li>4 cups chicken or vegetable broth</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>1 cup frozen peas (optional)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse the rice in cold water and set it aside to drain.</li>
        <li>Heat the vegetable oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the chopped onions and sauté until they become soft and translucent.</li>
        <li>Add the chopped bell peppers, ginger, and garlic, and cook for another 3-4 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Stir in the blended tomatoes, tomato paste, curry powder, thyme, white pepper, and a pinch of salt. Let this cook on medium heat for about 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the tomato mixture thickens and reduces.</li>
        <li>Pour in the chicken or vegetable broth and bring to a boil. Once boiling, add the rice, stir well, and reduce the heat to low.</li>
        <li>Cover the pot and let the rice simmer for about 20-25 minutes, or until the rice is fully cooked and the liquid is absorbed. Stir occasionally to ensure the rice doesn’t burn at the bottom of the pot.</li>
        <li>If using, add the frozen peas during the last 5 minutes of cooking to allow them to heat through.</li>
        <li>Once the rice is done, fluff it with a fork and garnish with chopped parsley, if desired. Serve hot with grilled chicken, fried plantains, or any side dish of your choice.</li>
    </ol>
