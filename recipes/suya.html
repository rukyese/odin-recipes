    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Suya is a popular Nigerian street food made from skewered and grilled beef or chicken, marinated in a flavorful spice mix. The seasoning for Suya includes a special suya pepper mix (called Yaji), which gives the dish its signature spiciness and earthy flavor. Often served with sliced onions, tomatoes, and spicy pepper sauce, Suya is enjoyed as a quick snack or a savory main dish at parties, gatherings, and outdoor events.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb beef or chicken (boneless, cut into cubes or strips)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup groundnut (peanut) powder</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons ground cayenne pepper (adjust to taste)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon paprika</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground ginger</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground garlic</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon onion powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground thyme</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground white pepper</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon bouillon powder (optional)</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>Skewers (wooden or metal)</li>
        <li>Onions and tomatoes (for garnish, optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine the groundnut powder, cayenne pepper, paprika, ground ginger, garlic, onion powder, cumin, thyme, white pepper, bouillon powder, and salt. Stir until the spices are evenly mixed.</li>
        <li>Add the vegetable oil to the spice mix and stir until it forms a paste.</li>
        <li>Coat the beef or chicken pieces with the spice paste, making sure each piece is well covered. For best results, let the meat marinate for at least 1-2 hours, or overnight in the refrigerator.</li>
        <li>Thread the marinated meat onto the skewers, spacing them evenly.</li>
        <li>Preheat the grill to medium-high heat. Grill the skewers for about 10-15 minutes, turning occasionally, until the meat is cooked to your desired level of doneness and has a slight char on the outside.</li>
        <li>Once cooked, remove the skewers from the grill and let them rest for a couple of minutes.</li>
        <li>Serve the Suya with sliced onions, tomatoes, and extra spicy pepper sauce on the side, if desired. Enjoy!</li>
