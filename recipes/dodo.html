    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Dodo, also known as Fried Plantains, is a popular Nigerian dish made from ripe plantains that are sliced and deep-fried to a golden crisp. The sweet and savory flavor of the plantains makes them a perfect side dish or snack. Dodo is commonly served alongside rice dishes like Jollof Rice or as a side to grilled meats and fish. The dish is a favorite at parties, street food stalls, and in many Nigerian households.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 ripe plantains (yellow and slightly soft)</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil for frying</li>
        <li>Salt (to taste)</li>
        <li>Optional: chili powder or paprika for a spicier version</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Peel the plantains and slice them into diagonal or round pieces, about 1/2 inch thick.</li>
        <li>Heat the vegetable oil in a frying pan over medium heat. Ensure thereâ€™s enough oil to submerge the plantain slices.</li>
        <li>Once the oil is hot, gently add the plantain slices to the pan, being careful not to overcrowd the pan.</li>
        <li>Fry the plantains for about 3-4 minutes on each side, or until golden brown and crispy.</li>
        <li>Remove the fried plantains from the oil and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to absorb excess oil.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle with salt while still hot. If desired, you can add a pinch of chili powder or paprika for a spicier kick.</li>
        <li>Serve the Dodo hot as a side dish or snack, and enjoy with Jollof rice, grilled meats, or a dipping sauce!</li>
    </ol>
